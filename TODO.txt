TODO
- model variations in the orbital elements by their value and rate of change
- derive orbit parameters (semi major axis and eccentricity) from tangent speed at t0
- look for a root finding method that guarantees finding the closest root to an initial guess
- alternatively: prove that only one phase root can exist under normal circumstances
