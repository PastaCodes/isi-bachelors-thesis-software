TODO
- figure out Q and a sensible P0
- test option for keeping cartesian position in the state vector instead of the mean anomaly
- derive initial estimates for orbit parameters (semi major axis and eccentricity) from tangent speed at t0 (?)
- look for a root finding method that guarantees finding the closest root to an initial guess
  alternatively: prove that only one phase root can exist under normal circumstances
